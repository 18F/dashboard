## Accepting/Merging Pull Requests

Typically pull Requests should be merged by a different person who opened them, ensuring that at least one other person has eyes on it.  If you see an open pull request that you agree with add a comment and :+1: -- a :+1: by itself merely indicates
that you like the direction and think it is a good idea, if you have reviewed the code or text, please comment that you have done so.  Unless it is a very small change or critical fix, pull requests should remain open for 24 hours to give everyone on the team a chance to chime in.

When a pull request is merged to staging it is automatically deployed to: [https://staging.18f.gov/dashboard/](https://staging.18f.gov/dashboard/)

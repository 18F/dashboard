## Background

There is a testing workgroup within 18F that wants to make sure code is healthy across 18F. It has been playing with various dashboard views into code quality and code health. For example, [here's a prototype](https://project-dashboard.18f.gov/default). To decide what to do next, the team developed hypotheses for future work. For all the details in that process, see [these notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18nPmH01Uz56xarHV66SVTU8f7boCr_ut5eQAArXzei4/edit).

## Summary

**We believe that:** surfacing metrics on %age of passing builds; %age of testing coverage; existence of linting; automated code quality diagnostics score; dependency status (systems that track if your dependencies are current, and secure)

**Will:** enable us to identify the pain points we should address first, or the projects most in need of assistance


**We will know we are right when:** we see product leads and 18F folks using the surfaced data to track project health

**We believe that:** partnering with project leads

**Will:** enable us to identify the pain points we should address first, or the projects most in need of assistance

**We will know we are right when:** we get actionable feedback


**We believe that:** resolving issues identified by our metrics

**Will:** ensure code quality; improve the teamâ€™s ability to deliver features quickly and at high-quality; ensure sustainable development velocity

**We will know we are right when:** the team expresses confidence in making changes to code

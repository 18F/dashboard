## Background

The Agile Guild did research into the current dashboard and what it might be in the future. All the detail is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H8Jq40_CYpmOjiXQZxBxZotyzZQmtS0i3-rLN2yZqYY/edit#). Maaaaybe related interviews are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_n2YScccqDXa283dS1yOUo3NEk).

## Key Questions

- Who is going there and what do they hope to find?  Note: the dashboard is getting quite a bit of traffic (see Analytics below and in linked doc).
- Is the dashboard meeting its initial goal of “transparency"?
- Are people finding what they need?  
- Does it accurately provide insight into how we work and where our project are in our process?  
- Are we effectively measuring the Success Metrics that we want to measure to track the impact of our projects?

## Audiences

In no particular order:

- our team (found no evidence that in its current state it is useful to anyone internally. Evidence that it is not useful / potential opportunity: See "Multiple Dashboard Initiatives” below
- agency partners (initial when proposed to investigate this, there was concern that this would come across as not-trusting our product leads.  Later via #product that someone had started investigation related question of agency partner experience, could be valuable to look at results of survey that went out)
- GSA and gov leadership (unknown)
the public - see analytics #s (Ethnio study in progress to investigate who these people are)
- prospective employees - candidates look at the dashboard to get a sense of the projects we’re working on and how we work.  Anecdotal evidence (based on people talking to me when I interview them or inbound requests for information interviews): people feel like discovery, alpha, beta, live are very significant to us, but I’ve not heard any product team member refer to any of these phases.  The project descriptions and links to news do seem to help.  Also people feel like they get a sense of scope.  They would like links to live sites, screen shots, or other artifacts to get a better sense of what these projects are.

## Analytics

If we look at the 18f website as a whole, we can see that the most popular pages are archived blog pages (which makes sense since these are the vast majority of the content).  Next is the home page, then the dashboard receives just over half the traffic as the home page.

## Process Challenges / Opportunities
**Challenge:** Product leads need to be prompted to keep the dashboard project.yaml source data up to date.   
**Opportunity** for it to be integrated with other processes so that the dashboard would automatically contain more recent / relevant data.
- Many (most?) projects have some kind of virtual kanban board (trello, waffle), some have roadmaps, some don’t, most of these have public links, the dashboard could provide a consistent place to publish these
- Most of the product team activity happens in github and slack.  One idea is to include something (perhaps the project.yam file) in the repo itself.  This would also enable a page that has a compelling showcase of our public github repos that welcome open source contributors to help people understand what all the project are and how/if to contribute.

**Challenge:** Monthly product reports. Every IAA includes monthly reports to agency partners.  We send out invoices, but there is no check that these reports go out or guidance about what might be most effective for them to include.  
**Opportunity:** Consider include some or all of those reports linked from or housed within the dashboard.  Consider a standard format (at least for a subset of the report) which would aid in setting and meeting expectations of agency partners.

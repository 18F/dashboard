## Background

On January 7, 2016, we published a blog post called [18F's New Year's resolution: Be even more open](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/07/18f-new-years-resolution-be-even-more-open/).

We now have [notes on potentially reusable tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1Hkjpk7W9Gjhx4mJ4HoiDntQv5N-NftLRBpi7FxWJc/edit).

However, our first resolution in our blog post was to develop metrics. I'm not sure if we've defined an explicit user need with regard to reusable tools other than we believe, generally, that open source is the most efficient way to develop code.

To paraphrase the illustrious Eric Mill's words into a hypotheses waiting for metrics:

**We believe that** many of the tools we build could be really useful for people who work at a variety of organizations  
**Will** _TBD_  
**We will know that we are right when** _TBD_

**We believe that** surfacing those tools, writing about them more, and identifying the parts of our work that are generic  
**Will** _TBD_  
**We will know that we are right when** _TBD_

**We believe that** decoupling them from the applications we developed them for will make it easier for others to reuse them
**Will** _TBD_  
**We will know that we are right when** _TBD_

## Background

Our website team has been anecdotally [tracking feedback](https://trello.com/b/YHdxZLxC/dashboard) on the dashboard and translating that into user stories. As of late January 2016, we have:

- As a potential partner agency, I want to see what is in 18F's portfolio and what kinds of projects they take on so I can see if 18F is an appropriate partner for my agency.

- As a potential employee of 18F, I want to see what projects 18F is working on and what skillsets are necessary so that I can see if 18F is an appropriate workplace for me.

- As a potential contributor to 18F's projects, I would like to learn more about products and product needs to see where I might be able to contribute to an open source project.

- As a staff member of a state/local government or other federal agency, I would like to see which, if any, 18F products I can adapt or use for my own needs.

- As a member of the press, I would like to have an easy way to see project updates so that I can see which, if any, warrant further attention.

- As a member of 18F, I would like to see other types of metrics, to assess financial and resource questions.

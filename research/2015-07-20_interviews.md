## Background

In July 2015, 18F held a 'transparency sprint' to work on and think about how better to structure internal mechanisms to support data-driven decision-making, and how best to share that information. To support this, we did user interviews with internal staff. Note: this research was focused on internal stakeholders and does not reflect potential needs of external dashboard users.

## Methodology

We conducted eight 30 minute interviews over July 20-23 with the following types of participants:

Position | #
--- | ---
Staff Managers | 4
Operations | 2
Product Manager | 1
Talent | 1
*Total Interviews* | *8*

## Summary

*Improve Project Views*
- Projected Staff Allocation: Perhaps the single biggest insight from the study is that users want to see what people are working on, what their availability is and what project needs there are. Basically, resourcing breaks down into three components:
1) projected staffing needs for each project and across all projects (i.e. what slots are there);
2) projected staff allocations (i.e. who’s filling which slots and how much); and
3) actual hours spent by staff on projects
- Project financials: Users need to see each project’s burn, both to date based on hours reported in Tock and infrastructure costs and projected into the future based on projected staffing.
- Project status: Project pages need to give a better sense of the project status beyond simply Discovery / Alpha / Beta. People need to have a more accurate sense of what’s actually going on with a project, and so the page could include things like:
  - Notable milestones
  - Individual accolades or high-fives for team members
- Project meta-data: In addition to repos, production URLs, and team members, project pages should also include contact information for product owners within the partner agency, usage analytics, IAAs and other documents, agency information
- Improved project list: There needs to be a standardized and unified projects list that is consistent between Tock, project dashboard, and accounting tools
- Upcoming Projects: The project list should include upcoming projects in the pipeline in order to see future staffing needs

*Improve Staff Views*
- Staff availability: Users need a view into staff availability projected into the future, both on an individual level and at the team level.
- What staff are working on: Users want to see what staff are working on (so how they report their hours in Tock), but are not interested in a billable / non-billable breakdown on an individual staff level.
- Staff skills and interests: Managers currently track staff interests and skills in various make-shift systems, and there’s a desire to have these visible in a more unified and public way.
- Upcoming Staff: In addition to current staff projections, users need to see projected allocations and availability for upcoming staff members. This data currently lives in a talent pipeline Google spreadsheet.

*Partner Agency Views*
- History of agency engagement: Users want to see the extent and history of 18F’s engagement with partner agencies, including all of the projects we’ve done or have scheduled.

## Dashboard Content

The data points for this project are listed as GitHub [issues](http://github.com/18f/dashboard/issues). Milestone [1](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/Sprint%201%20-%20MVP) issues are the most basic info that we intend to display in the initial list view of the dashboard. When users click on a project in that list, they will see the the data points listed under Milestones [2](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/2nd%20Sprint) and [3](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/3rd%20Sprint) on individual project pages. The [Backlog Milestone](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/Backlog) includes data points that need further research or are currently not a priority. 

Data was prioritized based on our initial interviews and guesses about how many of the audiences listed above would be interested in a data point, and then balanced against level of effort required to obtain or incorporate a data point. So, data that we think the most audiences would be interested in are in milestone 1, items that fewer audiences are interested in but require lower level of effort are MVP 2, and so on.

Is there data that you'd like to see about our projects that's not listed here? Create an issue! We value feedback.

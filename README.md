## Dashboard Content

The data points for this project are listed as GitHub [issues](http://github.com/18f/dashboard/issues). Milestone [1](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/Sprint%201%20-%20MVP) issues are the most basic info that we intend to display in the initial list view of the dashboard. When users click on a project in that list, they will see the the data points listed under Milestones [2](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/2nd%20Sprint) and [3](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/3rd%20Sprint) on individual project pages. The [Backlog Milestone](https://github.com/18F/dashboard/milestones/Backlog) includes data points that need further research or are currently not a priority. Please suggest data or comment on data points! We value feedback.
